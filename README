This analysis is the beginning skelton of a project to pull down all data from the FARS dataset, add them to hdfs,
and analyze with sparklyr. 

To run, make sure that you have postgres, hdfs and hive all set with the specifications in the code, and that the 
absolute working directories are changed to yours. You will also need access to the shell, so I am not sure 
how well this will work in windows.
